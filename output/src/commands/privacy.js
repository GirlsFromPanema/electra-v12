                **What data do we store and why do we need it?**
                We only store Bot IDs from selfmade Bots on Discord. It's necessary because Electra
                is checking for the Bots presence 24/7.

                **Where do we store the data and who has access to it?**
                We use SQL to store Bot IDs, only Koni#9521 has access to the Panel (as an Owner of the Bot)

                **Can I delete my data? What should I do if I have any concerns.**
                Of course, kick the bot from the server and all the stored data from your server will be removed.

                **Contact informations**
                Discord : Koni#9521 / email : blacktipemodding@gmail.com
