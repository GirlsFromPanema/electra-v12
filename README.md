# Electra - Discord Status Tracker
- The development of Electra has stopped, the Source is available here!

# Setup
- The Main folder is called "output". 
You can see a src folder, that's the same bot, but just in TypeScript.
- output/config.json => fill out token and bot owners
- If you want to use the main src folder (./src) you have to fill out config.json there (deprecated)

# Deprecated
- This Code base is outdated (discord.js V12, quick.db)
- Please head over to [Updated](https://github.com/Konrad570/rebrand-electra) for the newest Version.

# Contribution
- The development has stopped but you can still open Issue/Pull Requests (ONLY ON THE NEW VERSION) - Link above.

# Thanks
- Thanks everyone for using Electra for their Server.
- Created: 1/2020
- EOS (End of Service): 10/2021

- I am focusing on new Stuff, feel free to implement the Source in your Bots/Servers.
